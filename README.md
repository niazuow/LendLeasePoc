# LendLeasePoc
I have tried to demo the following featire.

1. TDD approach is encouraged ( Integrated Test cases are written )
2. Restful APIs ( both sync and Queue based are implemented )
3. In-memory cache database or Json objects can be used to store data. ( REDIS is used to store the data ).
4. Swagger is also implemented running on http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html.
NOTE: 

1 .During my interview, I thought you asked me a question on caching and I did not realise you were looking for Distributed type cache, thats why I tried to demo my understaing of REDIS.

2. I have also added the REDIS distribution with it, just run the redis server please before doing mvn package or mvn spring-boot:run
